**Knight Quest** is a geometry-inspired solution to the knightâ€™s shortest path problem. This method models the knightâ€™s movements as base vectors in the complex plane,
specifically using the canonical vectors **_( 2, 1 )_** and **_( 1, 2 )_** represented as **_u = 2 + i_** and **_v = 1 + 2i_**. These vectors are then rotated and mirrored 
according to the signed distance vector between the starting point **_( A )_** and the destination **_( B )_**, allowing for a modular decomposition of the knight's path. 
The solution operates by transforming the pathfinding problem into one of rotational alignment and mirrored symmetry, with strategic reference point **_( R )_** used to 
identify optimal paths across different directional regions. By analyzing the periodic structure of knight movesâ€”especially across diagonals like **_y = x_** and lines 
**_y = x/2_** the algorithm uses the repeating alternation in movement patterns to reduce the problem to a combination of sequence evaluation and rotation-based projection.
